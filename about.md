## About me

I am a Full Professor of Biometrics at the Universidad Mayor, in Santiago, Chile. My research interests are
related to theoretical and applied statistics for quantitative analyses of biological data, with emphasis
in ecological and natural resources phenomena.

 

My educational background had involved moving from forest sciences to statistics and mathematical modelling. 
Besides, through this I have been fortunate enough for meeting my mentors or professors that have been key for
my current duties. Furthermore, my collaborative work with Chilean and foreign colleagues, has strength the application
of my knowledge to different disciplines and problems.
