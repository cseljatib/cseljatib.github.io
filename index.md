**Welcome to my website!!** Here you could find information regarding my academic duties, such as research and publications, as well as on my research collaborators.

Our lab investigates how forest ecosystems change through time. We use both mathematical, theoretical, statistical and empirical approaches to address several research questions related to the development of forests; tree allometry; the scaling of tree-level processes to ecosystems; and the building of forest growth model. Our research also includes the long-term monitoring of the temperate forests in southern Chile.
