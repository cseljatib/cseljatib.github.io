A height-diameter model has the following structure
\begin{equation}
   h_i=f({\theta},d_i) + \epsilon_i,  \label{eq:modh.0}
\end{equation}       
where: $h_i$ is height at the $i$-th tree;
$d_i$ is diameter at breast height at the $i$-th tree;
$f()$ is a mathematical function; 
${\theta}$ is a vector of coefficients (i.e., parameters)  of model $f()$;
$\epsilon_{i}$ is the random term for the $i$-th tree following a Gaussian 
 probability density function having an expected value of zero and variance 
  $\sigma^2_{\epsilon}$. 
 Noice that function $f()$ could either be linear o non-linear.
